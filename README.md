# The Toolbox Show
"The Toolbox Show" is a new series I started where we learn Coding together (starting with Golang), and move on to writing our own little tools that help us with Hacking/Bug Bounty/CTFs.
Here you can find all the code that we use in our Twitch-Series.
Everything will be organized in Folders for every Episode including the link to the VOD.
